Silk Calendar Extensions [BETA]
==================

This is a wordpress plugin that runs on the back of the popular Calendar plugin by <a href="http://www.kieranoshea.com" target="_blank">Kieran O'Shea</a>

Simply put, I needed some extra functionality so I created this script, included is

Function to list all events in current month - silk_this_month()

Function to create a mini calendar that shows which day's have events + allows user to change month - silk_mini_calendar()

Creates single event pages that you can link to (auto generated within listing)

Obviously it may require a bit of tweaking for your solution should save you a ton of coding time.
